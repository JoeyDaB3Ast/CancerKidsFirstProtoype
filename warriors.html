                            Asher was 14 months old when he was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in October 2020. Asher was born premature at 34 weeks. He had a traumatic birth including coding and intubation, resulting in wheezing problems ever since he was 3 months old. As more Doctors reviewed Asher’s condition he was seen by a pulmonologist and diagnosed with asthma. After strictly following an asthma plan, his wheezing improved yet there was no change in a follow-up chest x-ray. Asher was next sent for an echo to see if his heart was the cause for his lung problems, but the echo was normal. With invasive efforts being discussed then exhausted, Asher was scheduled for a CT scan. Quickly after the scan, his very strong family was told they found a very large mass in Asher's posterior chest and believed it was neuroblastoma. This was when Asher's battle with cancer began. He has since been undergoing chemotherapy and other forms of treatment for his condition. Not only has he had to battle at such a young age, but through COVID-19. Our hearts go out to Asher and his family.

                            “Tommy was 3 months old when he started urinating blood, and was diagnosed with an unknown kidney tumor that day. Not long after, he had surgery to remove the left kidney along with the tumor and that's when we found out it was a malignant rhabdoid tumor. He then started chemotherapy and after about 6 cycles of chemo, during one of his regular scans a second tumor was found on his brain (ATRT). He then underwent a second surgery on his brain and they successfully removed the whole tumor with no complications. He restarted chemo and then had 3 stem cell transplants. He finished his treatments in October 2020 and his scans have been all clear ever since!” - Brittany, Tommy’s Mom

                            Hunter was unfortunately diagnosed with Optic Pathway Glioma at the young age of 2. This type of cancer is essentially a slow-growing brain tumor that arises in or around the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. As the tumor progressed, it pressed on Hunter’s optic nerve, which caused him to lose most of his vision. After four years of battling this glioma, Hunter has experienced countless brain surgeries and ER visits, along with several chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Despite his difficult life, he has always remained positive with a big smile on his face. Hunter is truly an inspiration to everyone who meets him!
